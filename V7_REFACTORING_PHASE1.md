# V7 AI Refactoring - Phase 1 Complete

## Overview
Phase 1 of the V7 AI refactoring has been completed, focusing on combat decision consolidation and emergency system improvements. The changes are designed for gradual migration using feature flags.

## Completed Modules

### 1. Centralized Weapon Selector (`decision/weapon_selector.ls`)
**Purpose**: Consolidates weapon selection logic from multiple files into a single, consistent system.

**Features**:
- Build-specific weapon priorities (Magic/Strength/Agility/Balanced)
- Comprehensive scoring system for weapon choices
- Range, TP cost, and effectiveness analysis
- Clear reasoning for weapon decisions
- Feature flag: `USE_NEW_WEAPON_SELECTOR`

**Key Functions**:
- `selectBestWeapon()` - Main weapon selection with build awareness
- `selectMagicBuildWeapon()` - Magic build prioritization (FLAME_THROWER + DoT)
- `selectStrengthBuildWeapon()` - Strength build prioritization (RHINO, ELECTRISOR)
- `selectAgilityBuildWeapon()` - Agility build prioritization (B_LASER, NEUTRINO)

### 2. Emergency State Machine (`decision/emergency_state.ls`)
**Purpose**: Replaces simple boolean emergency mode with proper state management.

**Features**:
- Four states: NORMAL → THREATENED → CRITICAL → RECOVERY
- Hysteresis thresholds to prevent oscillation
- State-specific action constraints
- Emergency history tracking for debugging
- Feature flag: `USE_NEW_EMERGENCY_STATE`

**States & Thresholds**:
- **NORMAL**: HP > 50%, standard combat
- **THREATENED**: HP 30-50%, defensive tactics
- **CRITICAL**: HP < 30%, survival priority
- **RECOVERY**: Post-healing transition state

### 3. Unified Combat Package System (`combat/combat_package.ls`)
**Purpose**: Replaces conflicting package/scenario dual system with single unified approach.

**Features**:
- Standardized combat package structure
- Build-optimized package creation
- Pre-execution validation
- Clear fallback hierarchy: Package → Scenario → Single Action
- Feature flag: `USE_NEW_COMBAT_PACKAGES`

**Package Types**:
- **dot_combo**: DoT weapon + chip combinations
- **dps_combo**: High DPS weapon chains
- **aoe_combo**: Area of effect combinations
- **single_weapon**: Individual weapon fallback

### 4. Consolidated Healing Logic (`decision/healing.ls`)
**Purpose**: Centralizes healing decisions from scattered locations into intelligent system.

**Features**:
- Emergency-aware healing thresholds
- Chip priority and scoring system
- Safety checks and offense-vs-healing tradeoffs
- Legacy compatibility functions
- Feature flag: `USE_NEW_HEALING_SYSTEM`

**Healing Priorities**:
1. **REGENERATION**: Critical HP (< 30%), once per fight
2. **REMISSION**: Moderate HP (< 50%), no offense available
3. **VACCINE**: Sustained damage (< 45%), heal over time

## Integration Changes

### V7_main.ls Updates
- Added includes for all new modules
- Integrated emergency state checks in immediate combat logic
- Added `checkImmediateCombatWithConstraints()` for emergency-aware combat
- Feature flag support for gradual migration

### Core/globals.ls Updates
- Added all feature flags for controlled rollout
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Debug flags for comparison testing

## Feature Flags

All improvements are controlled by feature flags for safe migration:

```leekscript
// Phase 1 flags (added to core/globals.ls)
global USE_NEW_WEAPON_SELECTOR = false;
global USE_NEW_COMBAT_PACKAGES = false;
global USE_NEW_EMERGENCY_STATE = false;
global USE_NEW_HEALING_SYSTEM = false;

// Debug flags
global DEBUG_NEW_SYSTEMS = false;
global COMPARE_OLD_NEW_LOGIC = false;
```

## Testing

### Test Script (`test_phase1.ls`)
Comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Individual module functionality
- Integration between modules
- Feature flag operation
- Error handling

### Testing Strategy
1. **Shadow Mode**: Run new logic alongside old, compare results
2. **A/B Testing**: Enable flags randomly per fight for comparison
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Enable one module at a time
4. **Fallback Ready**: Old logic remains available

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Code Quality
- Eliminated scattered weapon selection logic
- Reduced function complexity (weapon selection now < 100 lines per build)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent error handling

### 2. Combat Reliability
- Unified package system eliminates execution conflicts
- Emergency state machine provides predictable behavior
- Validated packages prevent resource desync
- Clear fallback mechanisms

### 3. Debugging & Maintenance
- Comprehensive debug logging with reasoning
- State transition history for emergency debugging
- Modular architecture enables focused testing
- Feature flags allow safe iteration

### 4. Performance
- Centralized logic reduces redundant calculations
- Validated packages prevent failed actions
- Emergency thresholds prevent panic loops
- Efficient scoring algorithms

## Migration Path

### Phase 1 Activation (Safe)
1. Enable `USE_NEW_EMERGENCY_STATE` first (lowest risk)
2. Enable `USE_NEW_HEALING_SYSTEM` (isolated improvement)
3. Enable `USE_NEW_WEAPON_SELECTOR` (test with shadow mode)
4. Enable `USE_NEW_COMBAT_PACKAGES` last (most complex)

### Validation Metrics
- Combat execution success rate
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Win rate comparison
- Error frequency reduction

## Next Phases

### Phase 2: Pathfinding Strategy Pattern
- Extract pathfinding strategies by build type
- Reduce 500+ line pathfinding function complexity
- Implement stalemate detection and breaking

### Phase 3: Error Handling with Rollback
- Command pattern for action execution
- Resource state synchronization
- Action rollback on failures

### Phase 4: Build Strategy Pattern
- Consolidate build-specific logic
- Dynamic strategy selection
- Clean API for build decisions

## Risks & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **New bugs in complex interactions**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite and feature flags
2. **Performance regression**
   - Mitigation: Performance monitoring and budget management
3. **Logic conflicts between old and new systems**
   - Mitigation: Clear feature flag boundaries and fallbacks

### Success Criteria
- Zero timeout errors
- Improved win rates (target: +10%)
- Reduced combat execution failures (target: -90%)
- Faster issue diagnosis through better logging
